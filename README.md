## Usage

When the application is first opened, the user can enter a city name into the search bar. Once the search is submitted, the current weather and five day forecast of that city will be displayed.

Each search that the user inputs will be saved and will show beneath the search bar. These past searches are buttons and can be clicked. The buttons will display that city's current weather and five day forecast when clicked. 

The "Clear" button will remove these past searches when clicked.
